# Simple Kubernetes Scaling API 
*A simple flask app to test a Kubernets autoscaling*

This is a simple program that I am making for my University project.

My project is to work with Kubernetes to understand how it can be used for scaling services. 

This brought up the need for a simple program that can be used to respond to API requests, and that gives me some control of how much load an API request has on a server.

To do this, a Python program will be written that exposes an API using [Connexion](https://github.com/spec-first/connexion?tab=readme-ov-file) , that performs and returns the result of a calculation.
